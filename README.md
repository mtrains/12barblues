A work in progress. The goal eventually is to have customizable backing tracks for jazz musicians to practice improvising over. 
To see a concept of what this will look like, see here: https://mtrains.github.io/12barblues/workinprogress.html There is obviously much work to be done, and I'll likely end up redoing it from scratch to ensure that the timings of the notes are precise enough for musicians. 
For now, you can play around with chords here: https://mtrains.github.io/12barblues/jazzchords.html
